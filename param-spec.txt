        Commonly used "param" arguments at this point include:

        "circwindow" -- the default package window that circuits should
        be established with. It started out at 1000 cells, but some
        research indicates that a lower value would mean fewer cells in
        transit in the network at any given time.
        Min: 100, Max: 1000
        First-appeared: Tor 0.2.1.20

        "CircuitPriorityHalflifeMsec" -- the halflife parameter used when
        weighting which circuit will send the next cell. Obeyed by Tor
        0.2.2.10-alpha and later.  (Versions of Tor between 0.2.2.7-alpha
        and 0.2.2.10-alpha recognized a "CircPriorityHalflifeMsec" parameter,
        but mishandled it badly.)

        First-appeared: Tor 0.2.2.11-alpha

        "perconnbwrate" and "perconnbwburst" -- if set, each relay sets
        up a separate token bucket for every client OR connection,
        and rate limits that connection indepedently. Typically left
        unset, except when used for performance experiments around trac
        entry 1750. Only honored by relays running Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha
        and later. (Note that relays running 0.2.2.7-alpha through
        0.2.2.14-alpha looked for bwconnrate and bwconnburst, but then
        did the wrong thing with them; see bug 1830 for details.)

        "refuseunknownexits" -- if set to one, exit relays look at
        the previous hop of circuits that ask to open an exit stream,
        and refuse to exit if they don't recognize it as a relay. The
        goal is to make it harder for people to use them as one-hop
        proxies. See trac entry 1751 for details.

        "Support022HiddenServices" -- Used to implement a mass switch-over
        from sending timestamps to hidden services by default to sending
        no timestamps at all.  If this option is absent, or is set to 1,
        clients with the default configuration send timestamps; otherwise,
        they do not.

        "FastFlagMinThreshold", "FastFlagMaxThreshold" -- lowest and

        for getting the Fast flag from being too low or too high.

        Every relay should list each onion key it generates for
        onion-key-rotation-days days after generating it, and then
        replace it.  Relays should continue to accept their most recent
        previous onion key for an additional onion-key-grace-period-days
        days after it is replaced.  (Introduced in 0.3.1.1-alpha;
