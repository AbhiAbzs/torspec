# Tor proposals by number

Here we have a set of proposals for changes to the Tor protocol.  Some
of these proposals are implemented; some are works in progress; and some
will never be implemented.

Below are a list of proposals sorted by status.  See
[README.md](/proposals/README.md) for a list of proposals sorted by number.
